                <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-balance">Depending on the geographical location, datacenters spend an average of 40% of their annual overall operating costs towards their power bill and 40% on their maintenance and other expenditure (*US chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center). The power bill and the maintenance costs are huge factors that affect the profit-maximizing conditions of the data center. The data center needs to reduce its maintenance costs and reduce its power bills to gain more profits. </p>
